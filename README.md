This changes the volume of the currenty focused application in kde, i used chatgpt to write the program so im sure theres a much better way to do this, but it works well enough. It should work on both wayland and x11 applications.

the usage command is: volctrl.sh <up|down> <value>
for example:

volctrl.sh up 10

volctrl.sh down 2
